		<h1>Applicability of the Act or earlier law to other persons liable to pay tax.</h1>
		<p>
49. Where in respect of any tax, interest or penalty due from a dealer under this Act or under any earlier law, any other person is liable for the payment thereof under any provisions of this Act or earlier law, all the relevant provisions of this Act or, as the case may be, of the earlier law shall, in respect of such liability apply to such person also, as if he were the dealer himself.
 </p>
 
<h1>Liability of commission agent and principal.</h1>
<p>

 
50. (1) Where a commission agent purchases or sells any taxable goods on behalf of his principal, such commission agent and his principal shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the tax payable under the Act.
(2) If the commission agent shows to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, in the manner as may be prescribed, that the tax payable by
him under this Act in respect of any goods, has been paid by the principal on whose behalf the goods were purchased, the commission agent shall not be liable to pay the tax again in respect of the same transaction.
(3) If the principal, on whose behalf commission agent has sold the goods, shows to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, in the manner as may be prescribed, that the tax payable under this Act in respect of any goods, has been paid by his commission agent, the principal shall not be liable to pay the tax again in respect of the same transaction.
</p>
 
<h1>Liability in case of transfer of business.</h1>
<p>
 
51. (1) Where a dealer, liable to pay tax under this Act, transfers his business in whole or in part, by sale, gift, lease, leave and licence, hire or in any other manner whatsoever, the dealer and the person to whom the business is so transferred shall jointly and severally be liable to pay the tax, interest or any penalty due from the dealer up to the time of such transfer, whether such tax, interest or penalty has been assessed before such transfer, but has remained unpaid or is assessed thereafter.
(2) Where the transferee or the lessee of a business referred to in sub-section (1) carries on such business either in his own name or in some other name, he shall be liable to pay tax on the sale of goods effected by him with effect from the date of such transfer and shall, if he is an existing dealer, apply within the prescribed time for amendment of his certificate of registration.
</p>

 
<h1>Amalgmation of companies.</h1>
<p>
 
52.

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the said order, for all the purposes of this Act, the said two or more companies shall be treated as distinct companies for all the periods upto the date of the said order and the registration certificates of the said companies shall be cancelled, where necessary, with effect from the date of the said order.

<h1>Liability in case of company in liquidation.</h1>

(b) who has been appointed as receiver of any assets of a company (hereinafter referred to as the "liquidator"), shall, within thirty days after his appointment, give intimation of his appointment as such to the Commissioner.
(2) The Commissioner shall, after making such inquiry or calling for such information as he may deem fit, notify the liquidator within three
months from the date on which he received intimation of the appointment of the liquidator, the amount which in the opinion of the Commissioner would be sufficient to provide for any tax, interest or penalty which is then, or is likely thereafter to become, payable by the company.
(3) When any private company is wound up and any tax, interest or penalty assessed under this Act on the company for any period, whether before or in the course of or after its liquidation, cannot be recovered, then every person who was a director of the private company at any time during the period for which the tax is due, shall jointly and severally be liable for the payment of such tax, interest or penalty, unless he proves to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that such non-recovery is be attributed to any gross neglect, misfeasance or breach of duty on his part in relation to the affairs of the company.
Explanation.--For the purposes of this section, the expressions "company" and "private company" shall have the meaning respectively assigned to them under clauses (i) and (ii) of sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Companies Act, 1956.
