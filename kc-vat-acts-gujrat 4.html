<h1>Security from certain class of dealers.</h1>
<p>
28. (1) Where it appears necessary to the authority to which an
application is made under section 21 or 22 for issue of certificate of
registration, so to do for the proper realization of the tax, penalty and interest
payable under this Act, it may by an order in writing and for the reasons to be
recorded therein, impose as a condition for the issue of certificate of
registration a requirement that the dealer shall furnish in the prescribed
manner and within such time as may be specified in the order, such security
as may be specified in the order for the aforesaid purpose.
(2) Where it appears necessary to the authority referred to in section
21, or the Commissioner so to do for the proper realization of the tax, interest
and penalty payable or which has become due for payment, for any period of
any year, he may, at any time, by an order in writing and for reason to be
recorded therein, require a registered dealer to furnish in the prescribed
manner and within such time as may be specified in the order, such security
or if such dealer has already furnished any security, such additional security
as may be specified in the order.
(3) No dealer shall be required to furnish any security under subsection
(1) or any security or additional security under sub-section (2) unless
he has been given an opportunity of being heard.
(4) The amount of security, which a dealer may be required to furnish
under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), or the aggregate of the amount of
such security, and the amount of additional security which he may be required
to furnish under sub-section (2) by the authority referred to therein or the
Commissioner, shall not exceed the amount of tax, interest and penalty
payable or which has become due for payment for a period of any year
according to the estimate of the authority referred to in sub-section (1) or
the Commissioner, on the turnover of sales or turnover of purchase of goods
of such dealer for any period of any year.
(5) Where the security furnished by a dealer under sub-section (1) or
sub-section (2) is in the form of a surety bond and the surety becomes
insolvent or dies, the dealer shall, within thirty days of the occurrence of any
of the aforesaid events, inform the authority referred to in sub-section (1) or
sub-section (2) or, as the case may be, the Commissioner and shall within
ninety days of such occurrence, furnish a fresh security for the same amount
as that of the bond in the form of a bond or in any other prescribed manner.
(6) The authority referred to in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) or, as
the case may be, the Commissioner may, by order and for good and sufficient
cause, forfeit the whole or any part of the security furnished by a dealer for
realizing any amount of the tax, interest or penalty payable by the dealer:
Provided that no order shall be passed under this sub-section without
giving the dealer an opportunity of being heard.
(7) Where by reason of an order under sub-section (6), the security
furnished by any dealer is rendered insufficient, he shall make up the
deficiency in such manner and within such time as may be prescribed.
(8) The authority referred to in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) or, as
the case may be, the Commissioner may, on an application made by a dealer
in that behalf, make an order of refund of any amount or part thereof
deposited by the dealer by way of security or for the release of bond under
this section, if it is not required for the purpose of realization of tax, interest or
penalty.
(9) Where a dealer fails to furnish security as required under subsection
(1), (2), (5) or (7), the authority referred to in section 21 shall refuse to
issue or, as the case may be, shall cancel the certificate of registration:
Provided that the refusal or cancellation of a certificate of registration
under this sub-section shall, notwithstanding anything contained in subsection
(3) of section 3, not affect the liability of the dealer to pay the tax,
penalty and interest due for any period before or after the date of such refusal
or cancellation of the certificate of registration; and accordingly the provisions
of this Act shall continue to apply.
