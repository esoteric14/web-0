(4) The Commissioner may requisition the services of any police officer or any public servant, or of both to assist him for all or any of the
purposes specified in sub-section (3).
(5) Where the Commissioner seizes any books of account or other documents or any goods, he shall give the dealer or the person present on his behalf a receipt for the same and obtain acknowledgement of the receipt so given to him:
Provided that if the dealer or person from whose custody the books of account or other documents or the goods are seized refuses to give an acknowledgement, the Commissioner may leave the receipt at the premises and record the fact:

(7) The Commissioner shall keep in his custody the books of account, registers or documents seized under sub-section (3) for such period not later than the completion of all the proceedings under this Act in respect of the years for which those books of account, registers or documents are relevant, as he considers necessary, and thereafter shall return the same to the dealer or any other person from whose custody or power they were seized:
Provided that the Commissioner may, before returning such books of account or other documents as aforesaid, place or cause to be placed such marks of identification thereon as appear to him to be necessary:

(13) If any person commits default under clause (a) or sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of sub-section (9), the Commissioner may, without prejudice to any other action which may be taken against such person under any other provision of this Act, direct, after giving an opportunity of being heard to such person that such person shall pay by way of penalty a sum not exceeding rupees fifty thousand.

(17) Where an order of detention or seizure of goods is made under this section and no claim is lodged by any person with respect to such goods within a period of three months from the date of such order, the Commissioner may, by order in writing, direct the auction of such goods:
Provided that if the goods, in respect of which an order of detention or seizure is made, are of a perishable nature or subject to speedy and natural decay or when the expenses of keeping them in custody are likely to exceed their value, the same may be ordered to be auctioned as soon as it is practicable soon after an order of detention or seizure of such goods is made and the amount so realised by the auction of goods shall be remitted in the Government treasury immediately.
(18) Where an order imposing penalty is passed under sub-section (14) or an option of paying penalty is exercised under sub-section (15) and the person liable fails to pay the penalty within the prescribed period, the goods detained or seized may be sold by public auction and the sale proceeds deposited immediately in Government treasury.
(19) Auction of goods to be made under sub-section (17) or subsection (18) shall be carried out in the manner as may be prescribed.
