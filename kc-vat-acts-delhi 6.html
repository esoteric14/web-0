			furnished by a person;
			the Commissioner may for reasons to be recorded in writing assess or reassess
			to the best of his judgment the amount of net tax due for a tax period 1[or more
			than one tax period by a single order so long as all such tax periods are comprised in
			one year.]
			[(1A) If, upon the information which has come into his possession, the Commissioner
			is satisfied that any person who has been liable to pay tax under this Act in respect of any
			period or periods, has failed to get himself registered, the Commissioner may for reasons
			to be recorded in writing, assess to the best of his judgment the amount of net tax due for
			such tax period or tax periods and all subsequent tax periods.]
			(2) Where the Commissioner has made an assessment under this section, the
			Commissioner shall forthwith serve on that person a notice of assessment of the
			amount of any additional tax due for that tax period.

			further tax is assessed as owed, the amount of further tax assessed is due and payable
			on the same date as the date on which the net tax for the tax period was due.

				(2) Notwithstanding sub-section (1) of this section, the Commissioner may make an
				assessment of tax within one year after the date of any decision of the Appellate  Tribunal or court where the assessment is required to be made in consequence of, or to give effect to, the decision of the Appellate Tribunal or court which requires the re-assessment of the person.

				assessment and has complied with the condition, if any, to entertain such objection in
				the manner provided in section 74 of this Act, the Commissioner may not enforce the

			 <h1>36A Tax deducted at source</h1>
			 <p>

				2[(1) Any person, not being an individual or a Hindu undivided family, who is
				responsible for making payment to any dealer (hereinafter in this section referred
				to as “the contractor”) for discharge of any liability on account of valuable
				consideration payable for the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in
				some other form) in pursuance of a works contract, for value exceeding twenty
				thousand rupees or such amount as may, by order in writing published in official
				Gazette, be notified by the Commissioner from time to time, shall, at the time of
				credit of such sum to the account of the contractor or at the time of payment
				thereof in cash or by any other mode, whichever is earlier, deduct tax thereon at the
				rate of 3[four] percent.
				5[PROVIDED that the rate of deduction of tax (TDS) shall be 6% in case of
				contractors not registered under this Act.]
				(1A) Any contractor responsible for making any payment or discharge of any
				liability to any sub-contractor, in pursuance of a contract with the sub-contractor,
				for value exceeding twenty thousand rupees or such amount as may, by order in
				writing and published in the official Gazette, be notified by the Commissioner from
				time to time, for the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some
				other form) involved in the execution, whether wholly or in part, of the works
				contract undertaken by the contractor, shall, at the time of such payment or
				discharge, in cash or by cheque or draft or any other mode, deduct an amount equal
				to 1[four] percent of such payment or discharge, purporting to be part of full
				amount of the tax payable under this Act.]
				3[PROVIDED that the rate of deduction of tax (TDS) shall be 6% in case of
				sub-contractors not registered under this Act.]
				(2) Where, on an application being made by the contractor in this behalf, the
				Commissioner is satisfied that any works contract involves both transfer of property
				in goods and labour and service, or involves only labour and service and accordingly,
				justifies deduction of tax on a part of the sum in respect of the works contract or, as
				the case may be, justifies no deduction of tax, he shall, after giving the contractor a
				reasonable opportunity of being heard, grant him such certificate and for such period
				as may be appropriate:
				PROVIDED that nothing in the said certificate shall affect liability of the
				contractor to pay tax under this Act.
				(3) Where any such certificate is granted, the person responsible for making
				payment under sub-section (1) shall, until such certificate is cancelled by the
				Commissioner, deduct tax at the rate specified in such certificate or deduct no tax, as
				the case may be.
				(4) The amount deducted under this section shall be deposited into the
				appropriate Government treasury by the person making such deduction 4[before the
				expiry of fifteen days] following the month in which such deduction is made in the
				manner as may be prescribed.
				(5) The person making such deduction under this section shall, at the time of
				payment or discharge, furnish to the contractor from whose bills or invoices such
				deduction is made, a certificate as may be prescribed in respect of the amount
				deducted, the rate at which it has been deducted and the details of deposit into the
				Government treasury.
				1[(5A) If any person referred to in sub-section (5) fails to furnish to the contractor
				the certificate of tax deduction at source within seven days of making payment or
				discharge, the person shall be liable to pay, by way of penalty, a sum of one hundred
				rupees per day from the day of making payment to the contractor or discharge until
				the failure is rectified:
				PROVIDED that the amount of penalty payable under this sub-section shall
				not exceed twenty thousand rupees.]
				(6) Any deduction made in accordance with the provisions of this section and
				credited into the appropriate Government treasury shall be treated as payment of tax
				on behalf of the person from whose bills or invoices the deduction has been made,
				and he shall claim the adjustment towards the payment of output tax of the amount so
				deducted in his return for the tax period in which certificate of such deduction was
				issued to him.
				(7) A dealer claiming adjustment in his tax return of the amount deducted under
				this section shall preserve the certificate issued to him for a period of seven years and
				shall produce the same to the Commissioner on demand.
				(8) If any person as is referred to in this section fails to make the deduction or,
				after deducting fails to deposit the amount so deducted as required in this section, the
				Commissioner may, by order in writing, direct that such person shall pay, by way of
				penalty, a sum not exceeding twice the amount deductible under this section besides
				tax deductible but not so deducted and, if deducted, not so deposited into the
				appropriate Government treasury.
				(9) Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-section (8), if any person fails to
				make deduction or, after deducting, fails to deposit the amount so deducted, he shall
				be liable to pay simple interest at the annual rate to be notified by the Government on
				the amount deductible under this section but not so deducted, and if deducted, not so
				deposited from the date on which such amount was deductible to the date on which
				such amount is actually deposited into the appropriate Government treasury.
				(10) Where the amount has not been deposited after deduction such amount
				together with interest and penalty referred to in sub-section (8) and sub-section (9)
				shall be a charge upon all the assets of the person concerned and recoverable as
				arrears of land revenue.
				(11) Every person responsible for making deduction of tax under this section
				shall apply to the Commissioner for a Tax Deduction Account Number within the
				prescribed time and in the prescribed form and shall also furnish a return in the
				prescribed form within the prescribed period 2[, and in the manner as may be notified
				by the Commissioner] :
				PROVIDED that, unless intimated otherwise by the Commissioner, every
				person having obtained Tax Deduction Account Number under the Delhi Sales Tax
				on Works Contract Act, 1999 (Delhi Act 9 of 1999) shall be deemed to have obtained
				a Tax Deduction Account Number under this Act and shall use the same Tax
				Deduction Account Number under this Act.
				(12) Any person who fails to comply with the requirement under sub-section (11)
				shall be liable to pay, by way of penalty, a sum of two hundred rupees per day from
				the day on which requirement arose until the failure is rectified:
				PROVIDED that the amount of penalty payable under this sub-section shall
				not exceed twenty thousand rupees.

				contract executed in the course of inter-state trade or commerce or outside the state,
				or in the course of import into or export out of India.]
