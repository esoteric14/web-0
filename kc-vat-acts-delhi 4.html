				(6) If any registered dealer whose registration has been restored under sub-section (5) of this Act satisfies the Commissioner that excess tax has been paid by him during the period his registration was inoperative which but for the cancellation of his registration he would not have paid, then the amount of such tax shall be adjusted or refunded in such manner as may be prescribed.
				(7) Every registered dealer who applies for cancellation of his registration shall surrender
				with his application the certificate of registration granted to him and every registered dealer

				cancellation.
				(8) The Commissioner shall, at intervals not exceeding three months, publish in the official

		<h1>25 Security from certain classes of dealers and other persons</h1>
		<p>
 

					3[(1) The Commissioner may, if it appears to him to be necessary so to do, for the

					continuance of the certificate of registration, or for the proper realisation of tax,

					composition money or other dues payable under this Act or as a condition of

					registering a person as a dealer or as a condition of making a refund under section 38

					of this Act, 1[or as a condition of de-sealing or release under sub-section (4) of

					section 60,] require a person or prescribed class of persons to furnish security for the

					proper performance of their responsibilities under this Act or under the Central Sales

					Tax Act, 1956 (74 of 1956) in the prescribed amount, in the prescribed manner and

					within such time as may be prescribed.]

					(2) Notwithstanding sub-section (1) of this section, the Commissioner may increase,

					is likely to become liable at any time under this Act;

					(c) the creditworthiness of the person;

					(d) the nature of the security; and

					(e) any other matter which the Commissioner considers relevant.

					(3) Where the security or additional security furnished by a person is in the form

					month of the occurrence of such event, inform the Commissioner and shall within

					three months of such occurrence, execute a fresh surety bond.

					(4) Where the surety bond has been executed by another registered dealer and

					the dealer’s registration is either cancelled or he has closed down his business, the

					person shall furnish a fresh security as may be prescribed and in the manner as stated

					in sub-section (3) of this section.

					(5) The Commissioner may, for good and sufficient cause, order the forfeiture

					of the whole or any part of the security furnished by a person.

					(6) Where the security furnished by any person is forfeited in whole or is

					the case may be, shall make up the deficiency in such manner and within such period

					as may be specified.
