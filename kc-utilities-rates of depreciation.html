1SCHEDULE II2

(See section 123)

USEFUL LIVES TO COMPUTE DEPRECIATION

PART 'A'

1. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. The depreciable amount of an asset is the cost of an asset or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. The useful life of an asset is the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use by an entity, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the entity.

2. For the purpose of this Schedule, the term depreciation includes amortisation.

3. Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of paragraph 1,—

3[(i) The useful life of an asset shall not be longer than the useful life specified in Part 'C' and the residual value of an asset shall not be more than five per cent of the original cost of the asset:

Provided that where a company uses a useful life or residual value of the asset which is different from the above limits, justification for the difference shall be disclosed in its financial statement.

(ii) For intangible assets, the provisions of the accounting standards applicable for the time being in force shall apply, except in case of intangible assets (Toll Roads) created under 'Build, Operate and Transfer', 'Build, Own, Operate and Transfer' or any other form of public private partnership route in case of road projects. Amortisation in such cases may be done as follows:—

(a) Mode of amortisation

 

Amortisation Amount

 
Cost of Intangible Assets (A)

Amortisation Amount =

 	Actual Revenue for the year (B)
Projected Revenue from Intangible Asset (till the end of the concession period) (C)
(b) Meaning of particulars are as follows :—

Cost of Intangible Assets (A)

=

Cost incurred by the company in accordance with the accounting standards.

Actual Revenue for the year (B)

=

Actual revenue (Toll Charges) received during the accounting year.

Projected Revenue from Intangible Asset (C)

=

Total projected revenue from the Intangible Assets as provided to the project lender at the time of financial closure/agreement.

The amortisation amount or rate should ensure that the whole of the cost of the intangible asset is amortised over the concession period.

Revenue shall be reviewed at the end of each financial year and projected revenue shall be adjusted to reflect such changes, if any, in the estimates as will lead to the actual collection at the end of the concession period.

(c) Example:—

Cost of creation of Intangible Assets

:

Rs. 500 Crores

Total period of Agreement

:

20 Years

Time used for creation of Intangible Assets

:

2 Years

Intangible Assets to be amortised in

:

18 Years

Assuming that the Total revenue to be generated out of Intangible Assets over the period would be Rs. 600 Crores, in the following manner:—

Based on this the charge for first year would be Rs. 4.16 Crore (approximately) (i.e. Rs. 5/Rs. 600 × Rs. 500 Crores) which would be charged to profit and loss and 0.83% (i.e. Rs. 4.16 Crore/Rs. 500 Crore × 100) is the amortisation rate for the first year.

Where a company arrives at the amortisation amount in respect of the said Intangible Assets in accordance with any method as per the applicable Accounting Standards, it shall disclose the same.]

PART 'B'

4. The useful life or residual value of any specific asset, as notified for accounting purposes by a Regulatory Authority constituted under an Act of Parliament or by the Central Government shall be applied in calculating the depreciation to be provided for such asset irrespective of the requirements of this Schedule.
